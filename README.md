Program Flow:
When the program is run, it has a default pin and balance amount. The user is asked to enter the pin in atmost three attempts. When the user enters the correct pin, he is prompted to enter a key to do the following operations which have been implemented using switch statements:
1 for Balannce Checking
2 for Cash Withdrawl
3 for Deposition
0 for Exit

As the name of suggests, when the user prompts the respective keys, the operations are coreespondingly executed and the balance amount is revised.

For the sake of clarity, the PIN for the program is set as 3169, the balance is initially set to 10,000 and the username is Akshay Aloriya.
